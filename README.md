A restaurant management system (RMS) handles various tasks such as taking orders, tracking available food and drinks, and booking tables. This system enhances restaurant efficiency, reduces errors, and offers features like comprehensive reports and secure storage of customer data. With added security measures, online food ordering and delivery can be made. An RMS that is easy to use and adaptable supports a restaurant's growth, contributing to its overall success.
